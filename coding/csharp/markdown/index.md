description: "How to code your Concordion fixtures in C# to make your specifications executable and automate the validation of the examples. By running the executable specifications, they create documentation. If validated frequently, they become living documentation."

Sorry, Markdown format specifications are not yet available for C#. We're working towards a 2.0 release for Concordion.NET which will support Markdown.

In the meantime, you can use [HTML]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.subject }}/{{ page.fixture_language}}/html) format.

Please subscribe to our twitter feed for announcements. If you would like to help create the 2.0 release, or discuss, please join our Google groups. See the links below.
