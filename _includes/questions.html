    <h3>Who developed Concordion?</h3>
    <p>
        Concordion was originally developed by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.davidpeterson.co.uk">David&nbsp;Peterson</a>,
        an agile consultant based in London, UK. The idea was sparked by conversations with testers and developers, in particular
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.natpryce.com/">Nat&nbsp;Pryce</a> and
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.higherorderlogic.com/">Steve&nbsp;Freeman</a>,
        while working at Easynet (BSkyB) in 2006.</p>
    <p>In 2013, <a href="https://github.com/nigelcharman">Nigel Charman</a> took over as project lead, having developed the Concordion extensions mechanism.</p>
    <p>Concordion has been ported and further extended by several other developers.</p>

        We also have a <a class="externalLink" href="http://groups.google.com/d/forum/concordion-dev">developer list</a>

    <a name="sourceCode"> </a>
    <h3>Where is the source code repository?</h3>
    <p>
        It is hosted on GitHub: <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/concordion/concordion">Main Project Page</a>,
        <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/concordion">all sub-projects</a>. The current
        development version (potentially unstable) can be cloned as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>git clone https://github.com/concordion/concordion.git
</pre>

    <a name="collaborate"> </a>
    <h3>How do I collaborate with development of Concordion?</h3>
    <p>
        Firstly, you should <a href="#issueList">create an issue</a> for your enhancement request.
    </p>
    <p>
        Concordion uses a "Fork &amp; Pull" model for collaborative development. If you have changes that you would like us to consider for introduction to Concordion, 
        you will need to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">fork</a> the repository, commit and push your changes to your forked project, and send us a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a> referencing the URL of the issue that you created.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that, in order to keep Concordion clean and minimal, we consider all enhancement requests carefully. Should your enhancement not be appropriate for Concordion core, you may wish to package it as a Concordion <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/coding/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#building-your-own-extension">extension</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        See README-DEVELOPERS.txt in the concordion repository for the development standards.
    </p>

    <a name="comparisonWithSelenium"> </a>
    <h3>How does Concordion differ from Selenium?</h3>
    <p>
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a>
        is a test scripting tool for driving web browsers.
        Concordion is a specification tool and hides scripting activity inside
        Java fixture code. For tests that exercise the browser, we recommend 
        <a class="externalLink" href="http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/">Selenium WebDriver</a> 
        with Concordion.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/concordion/concordion-screenshot-extension-demo"/>screenshot extension demo</a> 
project demonstrates Concordion working with Selenium WebDriver.
</p>

<a name="complexExpressions"> </a>
<h3>How do I use complex expressions in my Concordion specifications?</h3>
<p>
    In order to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/technique/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#keepSpecsSimple">keep your specifications simple</a> and maintainable, Concordion deliberately restricts the expression format that is allowed when instrumenting specifications. Complexity should be moved into the fixture code, and then <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/technique/{{ page.fixture_language }}/{{ page.spec_type }}#evolveDSL">evolved into a DSL</a>, where it is easier to maintain. The idea is to have the fixture do all the work of fetching and munging the data and then return exactly the data that the spec needs, which helps to decouple the spec from the implementation.
</p>
<p>
    However, if you really want to remove this restriction you can apply the annotation @FullOGNL to your fixture class. This would allow you to do things like <a class="externalLink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23658633/use-result-object-of-first-concordion-call-as-arg-in-secound-concordion-call">pass property values of Java beans into methods<a>, or <a class="externalLink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19681470/sending-a-constant-parameter-to-concoridion-execute-call">use constant values in concordion:execute commands</a>. 
    </p>

    <a name="ownDogFood"> </a>
    <h3>Does Concordion itself have active specifications?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, it has <a target="specs" href="http://concordion.github.io/concordion/latest/spec/Concordion.html">quite a few</a>.
        Obviously to begin with I didn't have the tool, so there are a lot of gaps!
