title: "Concordion | Getting Started | C# + Markdown"
description: "A tutorial showing the basics of creating a Concordion specification in C# with Markdown format specifications. By following the 4 steps of discussing, documenting, instrumenting and coding we create executable specifications that turn into living documentation when validated frequently. This shows the key patterns to implement Specification by Example (SBE) and Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) using Concordion."

Sorry, Markdown format specifications are not yet available for C#. We're working towards a 2.0 release for Concordion.NET which will support Markdown.

In the meantime, you can use [HTML]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.subject }}/{{ page.fixture_language}}/html) format.

Please subscribe to our twitter feed for announcements. If you would like to help create the 2.0 release, or discuss, please join our Google groups. See the links below.
