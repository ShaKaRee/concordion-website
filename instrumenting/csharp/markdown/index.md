Sorry, Markdown format specifications are not yet available for C#. We're working towards a 2.0 release fo Concordion.NET which will support Markdown.

In the meantime, you can use [HTML]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.subject }}/{{ page.fixture_language}}/html) format.

Please subscribe to our twitter feed for announcements. If you would like to help create the 2.0 release, or discuss, please join our Google groups. See the links below.
